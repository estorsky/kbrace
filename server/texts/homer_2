And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of
Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the
host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses
his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his
daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his
hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath and he
besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were
their chiefs.
